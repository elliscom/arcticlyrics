[Verse 1]
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the tide
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island, time-traveling
Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
That come to find you four in some velvet morning
Years too late, she's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

[Chorus]
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine? Woah, ah

[Verse 2]
I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

[Chorus]
And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?)

One for the road, ooh ooh
One for the road, ooh ooh

[Verse 1: Alex Turner]
From the bottom of your heart
The relegation zone
I saw this comin' from the start
The shake, rattle and roll
The cracks in blackout blinds
Cast patterns on the ceiling
But you're feeling fine
I thought it was dark outside
I thought it was dark outside

[Chorus: Alex Turner & Josh Homme]
One for the road
So we all go back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?

[Verse 2: Alex Turner]
I knew this would be on the cards
I knew you wouldn't fold
I saw this comin' from the start
The shake, rattle and roll

Arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots
And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger
And I ride it endlessly
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
And when she needs to shelter from reality
She takes a dip in my daydreams

[Chorus]
My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sittin' on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
As Arabella, oh
As Arabella

[Post-Chorus]
Just might've tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

[Verse 2]
Arabella's got a '70s head
But she's a modern lover, it's an exploration
She's made of outer space
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And her kiss the colour of a constellation
Fallin' into place

Blind faith, heartache
Mind games, mistakes
My sweet fireball
My sweet rigmarole

[Chorus]
I want it all
I want it all

[Verse 2]
Old dogs, new tricks
Can you feel it?
Space age country girl
Stone cold miracle

[Chorus]
I want it all
I want it all

[Bridge]
And then suddenly it hit me, it's a year ago
Since I drank miniature whiskey and we shared your Coke
Said, ain't it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road?
Leave me listening to the Stones' "2000 Light Years from Home"
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
So you're on the prowl wondering whether
She left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna
Never knowin' when to stop
Sunglasses indoors
Par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles

[Verse 2]
Call off the search for your soul
Or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends
Sippin' her drink and laughin' at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem

Mad sounds in your ears
Make you feel alright
They bring you back to life

[Chorus]
Mad sounds in your ears
They make you get up and dance, they make you get up
Yeah, they make you get up

[Verse 2]
Love buckles under the strain
Of those wild nights
Run but you cannot hide

[Chorus]
Mad sounds in your ears
They make you get up and dance, they make you get up
All night long they reappear
They make you get up and dance
Yeah, they make you get up

[Bridge]
Suppose you've gotta do what you've gotta do
We just weren't feelin' how we wanted to
You sit and try sometimes but you just can't figure out what went wrong
Then out of nowhere, somebody comes and hits you with an
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh

I can't explain but I wanna try
There's this image of you and I
And it goes dancing by
In the morning and in the night time
There's all these secrets that I can't keep
Like in my heart there's that hotel suite
And you lived there so long
It's kind of strange now you're gone

[Chorus]
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?

[Verse 2]
There's all those places we used to go
And I suspect you already know
But that place on memory lane you like still looks the same
But something about it's changed

[Chorus]
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?

The mirror's image tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin'
Carryin' your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreamin'
Of bumpin' into you

[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"
"Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

[Verse 2]
Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
I need a partner, (High) well are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of makin' alright decisions
And having bad ideas

[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply (Message, you reply)
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"
(Why'd you only call me when you're)
"Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

What's been happenin' in your world?
What have you been up to?
I heard that you fell in love, or near enough
I gotta tell you the truth, yeah

[Chorus]
I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feelin' I left it too late, but, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
I'll be here, waitin' ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

[Verse 2]
Forever isn't for everyone
Is forever for you?
It sounds like settlin' down or givin' up
But it don't sound much like you, girl

[Chorus]
I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feelin' I left it too late, but, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
I'll be here, waitin' ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

You got the lights on in the afternoon
An' the nights are drawn out long
And you're kissin' to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue
And you were sittin' in the corner with the coats all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

[Chorus]
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

[Verse 2]
Well, you cured my January blues
Yeah, you made it all alright
I got a feelin' I might have lit the very fuse
That you were tryin' not to light
You were a stranger in my phonebook I was actin' like I knew
'Cause I had nothin' to lose
When the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't comin' true
Ain't it funny what you'll do?

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathin' in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I will never rust
If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots, babe
I just wanna be yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours

[Chorus]
I wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours

[Verse 2]
Let me be your 'leccy meter
An' I'll never run out
Let me be the portable heater
That you'll get cold without
I wanna be your setting lotion (Wanna be)
Hold your hair in deep devotion (How deep?)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
I wanna be yours

Brian, top marks for not trying
So kind of you to bless us with your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted
And I wonder, are you putting us under?
'Cause we can't take our eyes off the t-shirt and ties combination
Well, see you later, innovator

[Verse 2]
Some want to kiss, some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get, 'cause you're smooth and you're wet
And she's not aware yet, but she's yours
She'll be saying, "Use me, show me the jacuzzi"
I imagine that it's there on a plate, your whole rendezvous rate
Means that you'll never be frightened to make 'em wait for a while

[Bridge]
I doubt it's your style not to get what you set out to acquire
The eyes are on fire, you are the unforecasted storm

[Verse 3]
(Brian) Calm, collected and commanding
(Top marks for not trying) You leave the other story standing
With your renditions and jokes, bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept 'cause you've stolen their thunder
Are you putting us under?
'Cause we can't take our eyes off the t-shirt and ties combination
Well, see you later, innovator

They've sped up to the point where they provoke
The punchline before they have told the joke
Plenty of desperation to be seen
Staring at the television screen
They've sped up to the point where they provoke
You to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
Well sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
It wasn't in the Top 100 list

[Chorus: Turner]
And it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told you, but you were dying for it

[Post-Chorus: Helders]
She saw it and she grabbed it and it wasn't what it seemed
The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means

[Verse 2: Turner]
Another variation on a theme
A tangle on the television and the magazine
D'you reckon that they do it for a joke?
D'you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
That says that "We are defenders of any poser
Or professional pretender around"

[Verse 1: Helders, Turner, & Helders & Turner]
He knew what he wanted to say
But he didn't know how to word it
The dirty little Herbert was seeking an escape
But the place was well-guarded
The guiltiness that started
Soon as the other part had stopped

[Chorus: Helders & Turner]
'D' is for delightful and try and keep your trousers on
I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare

[Verse 2: Helders, Turner, & Helders & Turner]
'D' is for desperately trying to simulate
What it was that was alright
Three quarters of an hour ago
That had led him to be in a position
On the brink of a mission
On the brink of an episode

[Bridge: Turner, & Turner & Helders]
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel—I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare

[Verse 1]
Running off over next door's garden before the hour is done
It's more a question of feeling than it is a question of fun
The confidence is the balaclava, I'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
Will the ending reek of salty cheeks and runny makeup alone?
Or will blood run down the face of a boy bewildered and scorned
And you'll find yourself in a skirmish where you wish you'd never been born?
You tie yourself to the tracks and there isn't no going back
And it's wrong, wrong, wrong, but we'll do it anyway 'cause we love a bit of trouble

[Verse 2]
Are you pulling her from a burning building or throwing her to the sharks?
Can only hope that the ending is as pleasurable as the start
The confidence is the balaclava, I'm sure you'll baffle 'em straight
And it's wrong, wrong, wrong, but she can hardly wait

[Chorus]
That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime?
That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime?

[Instrumental Break]

You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

[Chorus]
Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem, aren't as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up

[Verse 2]
Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging till I'm getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

[Verse 1]
In a foreign place, the saving grace was the feeling
That it was a heart that he was stealing
Oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
The eyes are bright, he couldn't wait to get away
And I bet that Juliet was just the icing on the cake
Make no mistake, no

[Chorus]
And even if somehow we could have
Shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have
Made it that bit better on your own

[Verse 2]
And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
But all the little promises, they don't mean much
When there's memories to be made
And I hope you're holding hands by New Year's Eve
They made it far too easy to believe
That true romance can't be achieved these days

[Chorus]
And even if somehow they could have
Shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have
Made it that bit better on your own
You are the only ones who know

[Verse 1]
Well, the mourning was complete
When there was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat
Several hours or several weeks
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

[Verse 2]
It's the beginning of the end
The car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
Ask anyone, they'll tell you that it's these times that it tends
To start to break in half, to start to fall apart, hold on to your heart

[Chorus]
And do me a favour and break my nose
Or do me a favour and tell me to go away
Or do me a favour and stop asking questions

[Verse 3]
As she walked away, well, her shoes were untied
And the eyes were all red, you could see that we'd cried
And I watched and I waited till she was inside
Forcing a smile and waving goodbye
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk, though
Look what it's done to your friends
Their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk, though
Look what it's done to your friends
Their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end

[Verse 2]
There's a room full of trouble and there's lovers to be had
Those ones who make sinners out of such lovely lads
Scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
And the anomaly is slipping into familiar ways

[Chorus]
And we're forever unfulfilled and can't think why
Like a search for murder clues in dead men's eyes
Forever unfulfilled and can't think why
Like a search for murder clues in dead men's eyes

[Bridge]
The more you open your mouth, the more you're forcing performance
And all the attention is leading me to feel important
(Give me obnoxious, give me obnoxious now)
Now that we're here, we may as well go too far
If you were there, beware the serpent soul pinchers
Three-hundred and fifty "No, thank you"s and nobody flinches
Go on, girl, go on, give us something gruesome
We require your grief, the thugs help the thieves
As they're trying to rob the words from her gob and
Take the swords to the innocents

[Verse 2]
If you were there, beware the serpent soul pinchers
Can't you sense she was never meant to fill column inches
Ain't you had enough? What you're trying to dig up
Isn't there to be dug; the thieves help the thugs
As they're trying to beat the good grace of a sweetheart
Out to the point she'll comply

[Bridge]
And why leave her on her own?
If I'd have known then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known
Why leave her on her own?
If I predicted tears then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known

[Instrumental Break]

Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier
It might make it worse

[Verse 1]
Oh, the night's like a whirlwind
Somebody's girlfriend's talking to me, but it's alright
She's saying that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me
He's not the jealous type
And I only need to get half an excuse and I'm away
But when there's no excuses, that's much easier to say
I've been before
And all these capers make us too good for her to ignore
See, she's talking but I'm not entirely sure

[Chorus]
Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier
It might make it worse

[Verse 2]
Oh, a sudden disheartener
Somebody's partner's talking to me
But I don't know that is what she isn't
She murmurs things to confirm that the tragedy is true
And I knew, how could she not? She could have anyone she wants
And I'm struggling to think of an immediate response
Like, "I don't mind, it'd be a big mistake for you to wait
And let me waste your time
Really, love, it's fine"
I said, "Really, love, it's fine"

Old yellow bricks, love's a risk
Quite the little escapologist
Looked so miffed when you wished
For a thousand places better than this
You are the fugitive but you don't know what you're running from
You can't kid us and you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love, you don't know what you're running away from

[Chorus]
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

[Verse 2]
She was enraged by the way
That the emperors were trapped in the cage
And the days she deemed dull
Leading to nights reading beer bottles
You're such a fugitive but you don't know what you're running from
You can't kid us and you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love, you don't know what you're running away from

[Chorus]
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

[Chorus]
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
With your hands between your thighs

[Verse]
Stop and wait a sec
And when you look at me like that, my darlin'
What did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you
With your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked
Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought
That I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though
It's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure
Such a perfect place to start

[Chorus]
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
With your hands between your thighs
